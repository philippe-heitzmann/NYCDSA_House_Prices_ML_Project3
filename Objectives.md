# Project Objectives

## Primary Goals

1. **Build High-Performance Predictive Models**
   - Develop machine learning models with strong predictive power for house price estimation
   - Achieve competitive performance on the Kaggle House Prices competition
   - Implement advanced ensemble methods for improved accuracy

2. **Enhance Object-Oriented Programming Skills**
   - Create modular, reusable classes for data preprocessing and model training
   - Implement clean, well-documented code following best practices
   - Develop a comprehensive pipeline for end-to-end machine learning workflows

3. **Deepen Machine Learning Understanding**
   - Gain hands-on experience with various ML algorithms and their characteristics
   - Understand the strengths and weaknesses of different modeling approaches
   - Learn advanced techniques like feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model stacking

## Competition Evaluation

**Metric**: Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of predicted and actual sale prices

**Rationale**: Using log transformation ensures that errors in predicting expensive and cheap houses affect the result equally, providing a fair evaluation metric.
